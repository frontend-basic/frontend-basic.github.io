    <h2>Position</h2>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        The <code>position</code> CSS property sets how an element is positioned in a document.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <code style='font-size: 24px;'>position: static | relative | absolute | fixed | sticky</code>
  </section>
  <section class="slide">
    <h2>Position</h2>
    The
    <code>top</code>,
    <code>right</code>,
    <code>bottom</code>,
    and
    <code>left</code>
    properties determine the final location of positioned elements.
  </section>
  <section class="slide">
    <h2>Static</h2>
    The element is positioned according to the normal flow of the document.
    The
    <code>top</code>,
    <code>right</code>,
    <code>bottom</code>,
    <code>left</code> and
    <code>z-index</code>
    properties have no effect.
    This is the default value.
  </section>
  <section class="slide">
    <h2>Relative</h2>
    The element is positioned according to the normal flow of the document, and then offset relative
    to itself based on the values of
    <code>top</code>,
    <code>right</code>,
    <code>bottom</code>,
    and
    <code>left</code>.
    The offset does not affect the
    position of any other elements; thus, the space given for the element in the page layout
    is the same as if position were static.
  </section>
  <section class="slide">
    <h2>Absolute</h2>
    The element is removed from the normal document flow, and no space is created for the element in the page layout.
    It is positioned relative to its closest positioned ancestor, if any; otherwise, it is placed relative to the
    initial containing block. Its final position is determined by the values of
    <code>top</code>,
    <code>right</code>,
    <code>bottom</code>,
    and
    <code>left</code>.
  </section>
  <section class="slide">
    <h2>Fixed</h2>
    The element is removed from the normal document flow, and no space is created for the element in the page layout.
    It is positioned relative to the initial containing block established by the viewport, except when one of its
    ancestors has a transform, perspective, or filter property set to something other than none,
    or the will-change property is set to transform, in which case that ancestor behaves as the containing block.
    Its final position is determined by the values of top, right, bottom, and left.
  </section>
  <section class="slide">
    <h2>Sticky</h2>
    The element is positioned according to the normal flow of the document, and then offset relative to its nearest
    scrolling ancestor and containing block (nearest block-level ancestor), including table-related elements,
    based on the values of
    <code>top</code>,
    <code>right</code>,
    <code>bottom</code>,
    and
    <code>left</code>.
    The offset does not affect the position of any other elements.

    <h2>z-index</h2>
    <figure>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          The z-index CSS property sets the z-order of a positioned element and its descendants or flex items.
          Overlapping elements with a larger z-index cover those with a smaller one.
        </p>

    <h2>Stacking context</h2>
    <figure>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          The stacking context is a three-dimensional conceptualization of HTML elements along an
          imaginary z-axis relative to the user, who is assumed to be facing the viewport or the webpage.
          HTML elements occupy this space in priority order based on element attributes.
